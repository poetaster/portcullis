Portcullis is a eurorack 2 channel Vactrol VCA with an Attack/Release op-amp. With no input signal on in, the A/R signal is routed directly to out. So you can use portcullis both as a vca and to produce A/R signals.

The A/R effectively swings between the nanosecond (?) domain to 5-6 seconds of release. 

I made this module to free up some space in my rack.
